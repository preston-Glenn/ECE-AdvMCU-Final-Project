# R5-Util


## Objectives
Create a program that will:
1. Initialise the R5 core
2. Parse the elf file 
3. Load the elf file onto the R5
4. Account for flags.
5. Few example programs.
    a) ld str
    b) loop iterator
    c) hello world maybe blink?
    d) RTOS??



Flag to load a program
Flag to set frequency
Flag to get status

We need some sort of workflow/ compiler to make the elf file format that we can use.





## TODO
1. Get dtb for R5s?
2. Run helloworld program on R5
3. Investigate writing to R5 memory
4. Try to write single instruction and run it

1. Try to load single asm instruction to R5 and run it and verify it. || DO example hellow world
2. Look into compiling workflow after that.




# Notes
1. Can get to the OCM, CDMA
